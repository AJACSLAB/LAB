# Maven
### What is Maven?
* Maven is an **open-source build automation and project management tool widely used for Java applications**.

### What is Maven: Features?
* Maven is loaded with many valuable and useful features
    * A huge, continuously growing repository of user libraries
    * The ability to set up projects easily, using best practices
    * Dependency management, featuring automatic updating
    * Backwards compatible with previous versions
    * Strong error and integrity reporting
    * Automatic parent versioning
    * Ensures consistent usage across all projects
    * It’s extensible, and you can easily write plug-ins using scripting languages or Java.

### Build Tools
* Build tools are the tools or programs that help create an executable application from the source code. As the name suggests, it’s essential for building or scripting a wide variety of tasks.

* The build tool is needed for the following processes:

    * Generating source code
    * Generating documentation from the source code
    * Compiling source code
    * Packaging the compiled codes into JAR files
    * Installing the packaged code in the local repository, server, or central repository


* **Project Object Model (POM)**

### The Need for Maven
* Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies, which refers to the libraries or JAR files. The tool helps get the right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.

### Advantages of Maven
* Helps manage all the processes, such as building, documentation, releasing, and distribution in project management
* Increases the performance of the project and the building process
* The task of downloading Jar files and other dependencies is done automatically
* Provides easy access to all the required information 
* Makes it easy for the developer to build a project in different environments without worrying about the dependencies, processes, etc.
* In Maven, it’s easy to add new dependencies by writing the dependency code in the pom file

### Maven has a few drawbacks
* Maven requires installation in the working system and the Maven plug-in for the IDE
* If the Maven code for an existing dependency is unavailable, you cannot add that dependency using Maven itself
